    <p>
    A man embarrassed in his circumstances, and conducting them imprudently, likes best to continue in the dark; he will not gladly reckon up the debtor entries he is charged with. 
    <br>
    But on the other hand, there is nothing to a prudent manager more pleasant than daily to set before himself the sums of his growing fortune.
